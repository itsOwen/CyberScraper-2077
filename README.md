## 🪟 For Windows Users

Please follow the Docker Container Guide given below, As I won't be able to maintain another version for windows system.

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077.git
   cd CyberScraper-2077
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Optional
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

6. If you want to use the Ollama:

Note: I only recommend using OpenAI and Gemini API as GPT4o-mini is really good at following instructions, If you are using open-source LLMs make sure you have a good system as the speed of the data generation/presentation depends on how good your system is in running the LLM and also you may have to fine-tune the prompt and add some additional filters yourself.
   ```bash
   1. Setup Ollama using `pip install ollama`
   2. Download the Ollama from the official website: https://ollama.com/download
   3. Now type: ollama pull llama3.1 or whatever LLM you want to use.
   4. Now follow the rest of the steps below.
   ```

   ```bash
   docker run -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:11434 -p 8501:8501 cyberscraper-2077
   ```
   On Linux you might need to use this below:
   ```bash

   ```
   Replace `<your-host-ip>` with your actual host machine IP address.

5. In the Streamlit interface, select the Ollama model you want to use (e.g., "ollama:llama3.1").

Note: Ensure that your firewall allows connections to port 11434 for Ollama.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Fire up the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

4. Watch as CyberScraper 2077 tears through the net, extracting your data faster than you can say "flatline"!

## 🌐 Multi-Page Scraping (BETA)

> **Note**: The multi-page scraping feature is currently in beta. While functional, you may encounter occasional issues or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your feedback and patience as we continue to improve this feature.

CyberScraper 2077 now supports multi-page scraping, allowing you to extract data from multiple pages of a website in one go. This feature is perfect for scraping paginated content, search results, or any site with data spread across multiple pages.

### How to Use Multi-Page Scraping

I suggest you enter the URL structure every time If you want to scrape multiple pages so it can detect the URL structure easily, It detects nearly all URL types.

1. **Basic Usage**:
   To scrape multiple pages, use the following format when entering the URL:
   ```
   https://example.com/page 1-5
   https://example.com/p/ 1-6
   https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1-3
   ```
   This will scrape pages 1 through 5 of the website.

2. **Custom Page Ranges**:
   You can specify custom page ranges:
   ```
   https://example.com/p/ 1-5,7,9-12
   https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1,7,8,9
   ```
   This will scrape pages 1 to 5, page 7, and pages 9 to 12.

3. **URL Patterns**:
   For websites with different URL structures, you can specify a pattern:
   ```
   https://example.com/search?q=cyberpunk&page={page} 1-5
   ```
   Replace `{page}` with where the page number should be in the URL.

4. **Automatic Pattern Detection**:
   If you don't specify a pattern, CyberScraper 2077 will attempt to detect the URL pattern automatically. However, for best results, specifying the pattern is recommended.

### Tips for Effective Multi-Page Scraping

- Start with a small range of pages to test before scraping a large number.
- Be mindful of the website's load and your scraping speed to avoid overloading servers.
- Use the `simulate_human` option for more natural scraping behavior on sites with anti-bot measures.
- Regularly check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure compliance.

### Example

```bash
URL Example : "https://news.ycombinator.com/?p=1 1-3 or 1,2,3,4"
```

If you want to scrape a specific page, Just enter the query please scrape page number 1 or 2, If you want to scrape all pages, Simply give a query like scrape all pages in csv or whatever format you want.

### Handling Errors

If you encounter errors during multi-page scraping:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the URL pattern is correct
- Ensure the website allows scraping
- Try reducing the number of pages or increasing the delay between requests

### Beta Feedback

As this feature is in beta, we highly value your feedback. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please:
1. Open an issue on our GitHub repository
2. Provide detailed information about the problem, including the URL structure and number of pages you were attempting to scrape
3. Share any error messages or unexpected behaviors you observed

Your input is crucial in helping us refine and stabilize this feature for future releases.

## Setup Google Sheets Authentication:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Select your project.
3. Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
4. Find your existing OAuth 2.0 Client ID and delete it.
5. Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID".
6. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
7. Name your client (e.g., "CyberScraper 2077 Web Client").
8. Under "Authorized JavaScript origins", add:
   - http://localhost:8501
   - http://localhost:8502
   - http://127.0.0.1:8501
   - http://127.0.0.1:8502
9. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add:
   - http://localhost:8501/
   - http://127.0.0.1:8501/
   - http://localhost:8502/
   - http://127.0.0.1:8502/
10. Click "Create" to generate the new client ID.
11. Download the new client configuration JSON file and rename it to `client_secret.json`.

## Adjusting PlaywrightScraper Settings (optional)

Customize the `PlaywrightScraper` settings to fit your scraping needs, If some websites are giving you issues, You might want to check the behaviour of the website:

```bash
use_stealth: bool = True,
simulate_human: bool = False,
use_custom_headers: bool = True,
hide_webdriver: bool = True,
bypass_cloudflare: bool = True:
```

Adjust these settings based on your target website and environment for optimal results.

You can also bypass the captcha using the ```-captcha``` parameter at the end of the URL, the browser window will popup, complete the capatcha and go back to your terminal window, Press enter and the bot will complete it's task.
