## üõ† Installation

**Note: CyberScraper 2077 requires Python 3.10 or higher.**

### Main Branch Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077.git
   cd CyberScraper-2077
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Optional
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install the playwright:
   ```bash
   playwright install
   ```

5. Set OpenAI & Gemini Key in your environment:

   Linux/Mac:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

### Scrapeless Integration Branch Installation

For enterprise-grade scraping with automatic CAPTCHA solving and advanced anti-bot bypassing:

1. Clone the Scrapeless integration branch:
   ```bash
   git clone -b CyberScrapeless-2077 https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077.git
   cd CyberScraper-2077

   ```

3. Get your Scrapeless API key from [Scrapeless Dashboard](https://app.scrapeless.com/dashboard/account?tab=apiKey)

### Using Ollama (Both Branches)

Note: I only recommend using OpenAI and Gemini API as these models are really good at following instructions. If you are using open-source LLMs, make sure you have a good system as the speed of the data generation/presentation depends on how well your system can run the LLM. You may also have to fine-tune the prompt and add some additional filters yourself.

```bash
1. Setup Ollama using `pip install ollama`
2. Download Ollama from the official website: https://ollama.com/download
3. Now type: ollama pull llama3.1 or whatever LLM you want to use.
4. Now follow the rest of the steps below.
```

   ```bash
   docker run -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://<your-host-ip>:11434 -p 8501:8501 cyberscraper-2077
   ```
   Replace `<your-host-ip>` with your actual host machine IP address.

5. In the Streamlit interface, select the Ollama model you want to use (e.g., "ollama:llama3.1").

Note: Ensure that your firewall allows connections to port 11434 for Ollama.

## üöÄ Usage

### Main Branch Usage

1. Fire up the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Enter the URL of the site you want to scrape or ask a question about the data you need.

4. Ask the chatbot to extract the data in any format. Select whatever data you want to export or even everything from the webpage.

5. Watch as CyberScraper 2077 tears through the net, extracting your data faster than you can say "flatline"!

### Scrapeless Branch Usage

The Scrapeless integration branch offers the same user interface with enhanced capabilities:

1. **Enterprise Scraping**: Automatically bypasses advanced anti-bot systems like Cloudflare, Akamai, and DataDome
2. **CAPTCHA-Free**: No manual CAPTCHA solving required - handled automatically
3. **Global Access**: Choose proxy countries for geo-restricted content
4. **Higher Success Rate**: Achieve ~95% success rate on protected sites

Example usage with page ranges (both branches):
```
https://example.com/products 1-5
https://example.com/search?q=cyberpunk&page={page} 1-10
```

## üåê Multi-Page Scraping (BETA)

> **Note**: The multi-page scraping feature is currently in beta. While functional, you may encounter occasional issues or unexpected behavior. We appreciate your feedback and patience as we continue to improve this feature.

CyberScraper 2077 now supports multi-page scraping, allowing you to extract data from multiple pages of a website in one go. This feature is perfect for scraping paginated content, search results, or any site with data spread across multiple pages.

### How to Use Multi-Page Scraping

I suggest you enter the URL structure every time if you want to scrape multiple pages so it can detect the URL structure easily. It detects nearly all URL types.

1. **Basic Usage**:
   To scrape multiple pages, use the following format when entering the URL:
   ```
   https://example.com/page 1-5
   https://example.com/p/ 1-6
   https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1-3
   ```
   This will scrape pages 1 through 5 of the website.

2. **Custom Page Ranges**:
   You can specify custom page ranges:
   ```
   https://example.com/p/ 1-5,7,9-12
   https://example.com/xample/something-something-1279?p=1 1,7,8,9
   ```
   This will scrape pages 1 to 5, page 7, and pages 9 to 12.

3. **URL Patterns**:
   For websites with different URL structures, you can specify a pattern:
   ```
   https://example.com/search?q=cyberpunk&page={page} 1-5
   ```
   Replace `{page}` with where the page number should be in the URL.

4. **Automatic Pattern Detection**:
   If you don't specify a pattern, CyberScraper 2077 will attempt to detect the URL pattern automatically. However, for best results, specifying the pattern is recommended.

### Enhanced Multi-Page with Scrapeless

The [Scrapeless integration branch](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077/tree/CyberScrapeless-2077) provides enhanced multi-page scraping with:
- **Automatic retry logic** for failed pages
- **Global proxy rotation** for different pages
- **CAPTCHA auto-solving** across all pages
- **Higher success rates** on protected paginated sites

### Tips for Effective Multi-Page Scraping

- Start with a small range of pages to test before scraping a large number.
- Be mindful of the website's load and your scraping speed to avoid overloading servers.
- Use the `simulate_human` option for more natural scraping behavior on sites with anti-bot measures.
- Consider using the [Scrapeless branch](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077/tree/CyberScrapeless-2077) for heavily protected sites.
- Regularly check the website's `robots.txt` file and terms of service to ensure compliance.

### Example

```bash
URL Example : "https://news.ycombinator.com/?p=1 1-3 or 1,2,3,4"
```

If you want to scrape a specific page, just enter the query "please scrape page number 1 or 2". If you want to scrape all pages, simply give a query like "scrape all pages in csv" or whatever format you want.

## üßÖ Tor Network Scraping

> **Note**: The Tor network scraping feature allows you to access and scrape .onion sites. This feature requires additional setup and should be used responsibly and legally.

CyberScraper 2077 now supports scraping .onion sites through the Tor network, allowing you to access and extract data from the dark web safely and anonymously. This feature is perfect for researchers, security analysts, and investigators who need to gather information from Tor hidden services.

### Prerequisites

1. Install Tor on your system:
   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo apt install tor
   
   # macOS (using Homebrew)
   brew install tor
   
   # Start the Tor service
   sudo service tor start  # on Linux
   brew services start tor # on macOS
   ```

2. Install additional Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install PySocks requests[socks]
   ```

### Using Tor Scraping

1. **Basic Usage**:
   Simply enter an .onion URL, and CyberScraper will automatically detect and route it through the Tor network:
   ```
   http://example123abc.onion
   ```

2. **Safety Features**:
   - Automatic .onion URL detection
   - Built-in connection verification
   - Tor Browser-like request headers
   - Automatic circuit isolation

### Configuration Options

You can customize the Tor scraping behavior by adjusting the following settings:
```python
tor_config = TorConfig(
    socks_port=9050,          # Default Tor SOCKS port
    circuit_timeout=10,        # Timeout for circuit creation
    auto_renew_circuit=True,   # Automatically renew Tor circuit
    verify_connection=True     # Verify Tor connection before scraping
)
```

### Security Considerations

- Always ensure you're complying with local laws and regulations
- Use a VPN in addition to Tor for extra security
- Be patient as Tor connections can be slower than regular web scraping
- Avoid sending personal or identifying information through Tor
- Some .onion sites may be offline or unreachable

### Docker Support

For Docker users, add these additional flags to enable Tor support:
```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 \
  --network="host" \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key" \
  cyberscraper-2077
```

### Example Usage

## üîß Branch Selection Guide

### Choose Main Branch If:
- You need Tor network support for .onion sites
- You prefer local browser control
- You want to use your current browser session
- You're doing research or educational projects
- Budget is a primary concern (free tier friendly)

### Choose [Scrapeless Integration Branch](https://github.com/itsOwen/CyberScraper-2077/tree/CyberScrapeless-2077) If:
- You're scraping heavily protected sites (Cloudflare, Akamai, DataDome)
- You need enterprise-grade success rates (~95%)
- CAPTCHAs are blocking your scraping
- You want automatic proxy rotation
- You need reliable, scalable scraping for business use
- You value time over manual configuration

## Adjusting PlaywrightScraper Settings (optional)

Customize the `PlaywrightScraper` settings to fit your scraping needs. If some websites are giving you issues, you might want to check the behavior of the website:

```bash
use_stealth: bool = True,
simulate_human: bool = False,
use_custom_headers: bool = True,
hide_webdriver: bool = True,
bypass_cloudflare: bool = True:
```

Adjust these settings based on your target website and environment for optimal results.

You can also bypass the captcha using the ```-captcha``` parameter at the end of the URL. The browser window will pop up, complete the captcha, and go back to your terminal window. Press enter and the bot will complete its task.
